The sample was used to assess whether an implementation adheres to the computational speed requirements from the FRIFTE E1N Test Plan. These values are chosen in such a way that allows the implementation flexibility while allowing NIST to complete the evaluation in a reasonable amount of time. If an implementation exceeds the maximum allowable duration, the participant will be asked to reduce the processing time of their software prior to NIST completing the evaluation. As such, all published FRIFTE E1N submissions conform to the published speed requirements. 2.1 Processor Details All measurements in this section were performed on a machine equipped with Intel Xeon Gold 6254 Central Processing Units (CPUs). Each CPU features a 3.10 GHz base frequency and 24.75 MB of cache. Timing tests are all single threadedâ€”implementations are not permitted to use more than one CPU core during any function measured here. As such, these values can be used to understand expected scaled performance. NIST testing code embraces the single-threaded nature of implementations to fork processes during other non-timed portions of this evaluation, allowing participants to write thread-unsafe code while still using NIST resources to their maximum efficiency. This CPU supports executing several families of processor intrinsic functions, including AVX-5121. 2.2 Composition Table 2.1 shows the quantity of each type of fingerprint record comprising the Timing Sample, along with the maximum allowable feature extraction time permitted by FRIFTE E1N for that type of record.

While the participant-defined enrollment database should contain information about all references, the space consumed by the enrollment database may be significantly different than the space consumed by concatenation of all individual reference templates. Additionally, the participant-defined database structure may be a structure unique for this evaluation and not necessarily similar to a structure deployed operationally. The sum of sizes for both types of reference storage are shown in Table 2.4 along with the difference between the two, for the various enrollment databases generated as part of the Timing Sample dataset. The Templates column is computed by summing the buffer size returned by the createTemplate() API function. The Database column is computed by recursively summing the file sizes (as determined by the stat() syscall) of all files remaining in the database directory after returning from the createEnrollmentDatabase() API function.

The results presented in Subsection 2.5 are based on the measurements made during those searches. 2.5.1 Search Duration Table 2.5 shows the amount of time elapsed during searches of the probe sets when searching against the enrollment databases described in Subsection 2.4. While unsuccessful searches expend operator time, they are not included in this metric, because search failures typically occur instantaneously (e.g., a template indicates that a probe was of too poor quality to search), which can artificially lower the average search time. FRIFTE E1N defines maximum average search durations for participants based on the number of subjects in the enrollment database. Due to the potential for extended runtimes, NIST may choose to allow some discretion in the enforcement of maximum search durations during times of high demand for compute resources. For example, if a maximum average search duration was 200 seconds, but after completing all searches, the average search duration was 210 seconds, it may be prudent to continue the evaluation, since a resubmission may require regeneration of millions of templates and several thousand repeated searches.

This is particularly useful when the probe template does not include a finger position. When the implementation is invoked in this way, search accuracy metrics are reported in terms of a locationâ€”region or subject. Region: The correct region of the correct subject was returned. For probes sourced from a distal phalanx, the correct position 1â€“10 shall be returned. For probes sourced from a palm or a non-distal phalanx, the most localized region shall be returned. Some palm regions may be interchangeable based on the exemplars provided (e.g., a palm probeâ€™s source could reasonably be seen in a lower palm, hypothenar, and writerâ€™s palm exemplar). Credit is given for Region in this case. Subject: Any position from the correct subject is returned. This is designed to reward the situation where an implementation cannot ascertain the most localized region from the set of exemplars enrolled and may indicate segmentation error. 3.1.1 Notes Multi-position probes are never requested to return a finger position. 3.2 Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) The Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) plots in this document show the tradeoff between the False Positive Identification Rate (FPIR) and False Negative Identification Rate (FNIR) when searching probes against an enrollment database. For mated searches (used to compute FNIR), a single mated identity for each probe was present in the enrollment database. For non-mated searches (used to compute FPIR), there was no mate for the probe in the enrollment database. 3.2.1 Notes The requested size of the candidate list was always 100 subjects. The set of non-mated similarity scores come from the highest score when searching probes without a mate present in the enrollment database. The set of mated similarity scores comes from searches of probes where the mate is present in the enrollment database and the algorithm successfully found the mate. The mate may appear at any rank in the candidate list. Due to the quantity of searches, a sample of scores across the entire range of mated and non-mated scores were used to produce DET values. 3.3 Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) The Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) plots in this document show the FNIR without respect for similarity score when searching probes against an enrollment database where a single mated identity for each probe was present. A description of the non-mated subject records represented in an enrollment database is documented in subsequent sections. 3.3.1 Notes The metric hit rate is equivalent to 1 âˆ’ miss rate, or 1 âˆ’ FNIR. For example, an FNIR of 0.1 indicates a hit rate of 0.9 (i.e., 90%).
